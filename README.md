# Updated Portfolio

For this project I used the same concept that I had from my original portfolio with major design tweaks.

I used a CSS framework called Bulma because they are mobile friendly.

I also used CSS stylesheets from Google Fonts and Font Awesome.

For background images, I used personal pictures from vacations I took on my phone.
